Stripped down for action, the CB1000 Hornet has uncompromising streetfighter style, highlighted by the piercing light of super-compact twin LED headlights, wrapped in a discreet front fairing. The partially hidden frame is a strong element of the agile design, while also emphasising the lines, as does the rear trellis subframe. To add even more menace, the engine, wheels and swingarm are also finished in black. The Hornet''s signature wide-slung fuel tank, which tapers dramatically towards the rear, highlights the raw performance.', 19),
